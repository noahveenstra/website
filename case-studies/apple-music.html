                        <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <p>
                            My primary motivation to create this case study was the frustration I felt when using Apple
                            Music
                            compared to Spotify. I had used both before and gone through a bit of an on and off cycle
                            with both
                            products. Throughout this time I noticed many differences between them that made one better
                            than the
                            other. Unfortunately, Spotify was the service I preferred. This is unfortunate only because
                            I am a
                            die-hard Apple fan and user. I've wanted so badly to use Apple Music because of its tight
                            integration with iOS but I can't overlook its downfalls when put head to head with the
                            competition.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Along with this, among peers and friends, Spotify was the preferred choice. I didn't have to
                            look
                            hard to find someone using Spotify who was also using an iPhone. Just walking down any
                            hallway all I
                            needed to do was glance at someone who was on their phone listening to music and 8 out of 10
                            times
                            it would be Spotify. This made me wonder why would someone, who bought into the Apple
                            ecosystem with
                            an iPhone, still chose a music service that required multiple steps to set up and pay for
                            outside of
                            the native Music app.

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Throughout this study, I'll look for answers to issues that Apple has created with their
                            On-Demand
                            Music service Apple Music. Along with how Apple can create features to entice more of the 18
                            - 24
                            year old age group to switch from Spotify.

                        <h1>Problem</h1>
                        <h4>The Age Disparity</h4>
                        <p>
                            The most obvious metric that shows concern is the number of users that are
                            between 18
                            and 24 using Apple Music. According to Statista, in 2018 Apple Music had a total of 49.5
                            million
                            users in the US and only 17% of those users were in this age bracket.

                            This is a small percentage, especially compared to Spotify's 26%, of users each month that
                            are not
                            being properly catered to. To be more precise, for Apple Music, this number from 2018 comes
                            to
                            around 8.42 million users. For Spotify in that same year, the numbers boil down to 46.8
                            million
                            users in this age bracket. This is over 5x the amount of young Spotify users compared Apple
                            Music
                            users. While it looks like Spotify's growth in this age range is not slowing down, there are
                            a few
                            simple solutions that can be implemented to put Apple ahead.

                            I asked friends and peers that use both services to compare the two services on a Google
                            Jamboard so
                            they could freely add whatever they felt was prevalent. After about a week I got a board
                            that
                            outlined key differences between the two.

                            I looked at these differences and tried to put them in priority order from most to least
                            important.
                            Then, I decided to also create a list of the most achievable desired features from most
                            desired to
                            least. These lists are from Apple's point of view.

                            Using these two lists, I created a system that allowed me to determine which problems to
                            tackle
                            in this study. Per list, each item receives points based on how far up or down they are on
                            the
                            list. The first item gets 1 point, the second item gets 2 points, and so on. After each item
                            received its points, you subtract the items that have the same name, and the items that were
                            closest to 0 were the most important and most achievable objectives, so I worked on the
                            first
                            two: Likes and Group Sessions.

                        <h4>Where's the Love?</h4>
                        <p>
                            In this day and age of social media, we are constantly liking and loving posts from a wide
                            range of
                            accounts. On pretty much every platform you can view your liked posts and look back through
                            them.
                            Now, Apple Music does allow you to 'Love' a song, album, or playlist, but there is nowhere
                            to view
                            everything you loved. This is a major miss for its users as some leave just for this one
                            feature.
                        </p>
                        <figure class="data1">
                            <img src="/assets/apple-music-tabs.png" alt="" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            The solution I devised for this problem was to create a new bottom row tab called 'Loves.'
                            No longer
                            would the user be clueless about where their mysterious loved songs went. This gave a clear
                            home for
                            everything that you love inside Apple Music. Now, what happens to the radio section that was
                            just
                            wiped away from our user's home bar? It moves into the browse page. And there is a clear
                            back button
                            so the user doesn't get stuck or confused on this new page. When you think about looking for
                            music
                            to listen to, sometimes you want that radio. Keeping it in the app and putting it in a
                            subcategory
                            that fits it is why it was moved. Of course, all the same, algorithmically generated
                            suggestions for
                            radio in 'Listen Now' will be present.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now that our Radio friend is taken care of, let's look more into the new 'Loves' tab.
                            Thinking
                            solely about the user and what they would want right at their fingertips, the first
                            suggestion
                            they get is the 'On Rotation playlist. This playlist is procedurally generated from songs
                            that
                            they've loved and continue to come back to multiple times. This lets the user not only have
                            a
                            playlist that they will very likely love to listen to, but it will give an easy way to find
                            songs that they want to play again without going to search.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Digging through any UI, even the beautifully designed ones, is everyone's worst nightmare.
                            Within a music app, users want to find music they want to listen to then close it and be
                            done.
                            That's why this next section is devoted to the most recently loved items. Whether it be
                            Songs,
                            Playlists, Albums, or Artists, they will show up in the carousel of 'Recently Loved.' This
                            gives
                            the user the ability to find what has been relevant to them recently and gives somewhat of a
                            timeline of their recent preferences. Having the section within one click also keeps the
                            decision path simple. Does a user want to find a song they loved just a couple of days ago?
                            Great, all it takes is a tap or a swipe of the carousel and they've found it.

                            One shortcoming of Apple Music has been its lackluster features. This brings us to the
                            'Loved by
                            Mood' area. This area will create procedurally generated playlists to coincide with an array
                            of
                            different moods. It would determine these mostly from scanning for the song's beats per
                            minute
                            (BPM). The BPM of a song is usually a good indicator of its mood and energy. The higher the
                            BPM,
                            the quicker the song feels, and most of the time more energetic. The playlists would contain
                            songs the user has loved that fit the category as well as new songs that have similar
                            attributes. This way the user can discover new songs within the category they are listening
                            to
                            and possibly add them to their library of loved songs.

                        <h4>Two's Company, Three's a Crowd</h4>
                        <p>
                            Driving in a car with a group of people or maybe just with a partner is a great way to
                            connect. More
                            often than not someone else wants to play music from their Library to the current speaker.
                            To do
                            this, the first person has to disconnect from the speaker, then the second person has to
                            pair and
                            connect to it. Such a cumbersome and complicated process that it rarely ever happens. The
                            solution I
                            concluded was to add an iteration of SharePlay directly inside the Music app.

                            ðŸ’¡ ICYMI, SharePlay was released on iOS 15.1 in December 2021. It allows users to share
                            their
                            screen, tv show, or music all through FaceTime. It is mostly known for its screen sharing
                            ability
                            after coming at the end of a video call (Zoom dominated) year. Nonetheless, Apple did
                            present it
                            with the other features of music and select tv show sharing capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, SharePlay is already built into the music menu. The only issue is that if you try
                            to add
                            someone to your SharePlay it says that the media type is unable to SharePlay. Although this
                            is not
                            the truth, what they want you to do is be on a FaceTime Audio or Video call in order to use
                            this
                            feature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The implementation that I would have built allows for users to create a SharePlay session,
                            no matter
                            the context, and share it with up to 15 people. If you weren't the source user, you would be
                            able to
                            add songs to the queue but not skip or reverse songs. This still allows for control over
                            what the
                            source user's phone is playing and eliminates a potential headache for all the users. If
                            everyone
                            was given the ability to switch songs, human nature would kick in and there would be a race
                            to get
                            to the song they added.

                            When creating a new system that relies so heavily on the song queue, you have to reconsider
                            how it
                            looks and feels. When looking at the queue, all users are able to see the names of who added
                            which
                            song. Adding a bit of personalization to the queue will create a sense of community and
                            bonding. The
                            queue for the users that don't have the source phone, will be slightly different. Their
                            queue will
                            show a three dotted menu next to each song in order to get more information on it, add it to
                            their
                            library and, of course, love it. Non-souce users are also not able to change the order of
                            the queue.
                            This gives a fair chance for each user to play the song they like and have it heard. But,
                            the queue
                            for the source user will look the same and be the 'admin' in a sense, able to change the
                            order of
                            songs, delete them from the queue and remove users from the SharePlay session if need be.

                        <p>
                            From these proposed changes, I hope more thought is provoked around Apple Music and its
                            potential to
                            overtake Spotify and its dominance. I truly believe that these changes would have a positive
                            impact
                            on everyone that uses Apple Music and elevate their interactive experience with the service.
                            Unfortunately, it seems like Apple has become complacent with requests from users since the
                            service
                            has launched back in 2015 just because they can and people will still subscribe. These
                            findings and
                            solutions have been created to showcase my ability to problem solve and go through the
                            process of
                            the decisions I felt were necessary.

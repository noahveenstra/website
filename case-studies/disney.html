                        This year at Apple’s WWDC, they announced a new feature called Live Activity. This feature
                        allows app developers to
                        create a more persistent notification experience. From tracking the score of your favorite
                        sports team to knowing
                        exactly when your Uber will arrive without unlocking your phone. This is a powerful feature for
                        the usability and user
                        experience of certain apps. It allows you to not have to unlock your phone, search for the app,
                        wait for it to load, and
                        finally get the information you want. With Live Activities, you simply just glance at your lock
                        screen and know the
                        status of what you’re waiting on or the event you’re following.

                    <h1>Mobile Ordering</h1>
                    <p>
                        This is where Disney World, along with their app, My Disney Experience, comes into play. I
                        decided to make a concept as
                        to what these Live Activity Notifications could look like while keeping the same style as the
                        app. The first integration
                        was with the mobile ordering experience. Mobile ordering took Disney World by storm within the
                        last year and a half due
                        to the COVID pandemic and this has brought about some friction among users. Most users think the
                        process of ordering
                        food and picking it up is too cumbersome and confusing, so they opt for waiting in line, now
                        that COVID restrictions
                        have been lifted. Meaning, that all the time and money invested into the mobile ordering
                        experience has gone unnoticed.
                        This feature added to the app may pour some grease to reduce the friction and make it more
                        usable.

                        <img src="/assets/disney1.png" alt="">
                    </center>
                    <p>
                        The current UI for checking the status of your order is very similar to my solution in Live
                        Activities. But the
                        advantages, come with not having to open your phone and find the button to press. It’s right in
                        front of you. This
                        prompt appears right after you place your order. I thought of the idea of only showing it after
                        you were within a
                        certain radius of the restaurant. But, the decision was made to disregard this choice because of
                        finicky GPS signals and
                        the failure case where someone could be inside the restaurant but their GPS is off and therefore
                        wouldn’t be able to
                        start the order.
                    </p>
                    <center>
                        <img src="/assets/disney2.png" alt="">
                    </center>
                    <p>
                        The second step is really just a status. For the user to know that the order is being made. And
                        for the user to know
                        that the notification isn’t stuck, or crashing, the illustration on left will animate, and flip
                        the burger every now and
                        then. Also, the greyed-out progress bar will have a pulsing lighter grey going from left to
                        right. Just some visual
                        queues to make sure the user knows, “Ok, my food is cooking and this notification is continually
                        updating and is alive
                        so I just need to wait until the whole progress bar is green.”
                    </p>
                    <div class="side-by-side">
                        <img src="/assets/disney3.png" alt="">
                        <img src="/assets/disney4.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The third and final step is the confirmation screen. This tells the user that their food is
                        ready and where to pick it
                        up quickly and easily. This screen expires after 20 minutes, or if you dismiss it. You can also
                        look at granular details
                        in the order summary. If you tap on the bottom section anywhere, you get a breakdown of the
                        costs per item.

                <section>
                    <h1>Lightning Lanes</h1>
                    <p>
                        The other implementation I saw that this brand new feature of iOS could be used is with
                        Lightning Lanes. Some of the
                        same issues have been present since the introduction of Lightning Lanes versus what was
                        previously available, FastPass+.
                        Users have complained about waking up early just to reserve two passes for the day of. Now,
                        there are multiple issues
                        with the user’s flow when looking at Lightning Lanes, but I’m only going to focus on the user’s
                        flow after a reservation
                        is made. What can be enhanced within the park? How can it be even easier to use the technology
                        available and sprinkle a
                        bit of pixie dust on every user’s day?
                    </p>
                    <center>
                        <img src="/assets/disney5.png" alt="">
                    </center>
                    <p>
                        The implementation is very similar to mobile ordering. But there are a few differences when you
                        “Check In.” So, once
                        again, the ability to check in is not tied to GPS. Because you can’t use the Lightning Lane on
                        anything but the ride
                        it’s assigned to, you can check in wherever so long as it’s within the time frame of your
                        reservation.
                    </p>
                    <center>
                        <img src="/assets/disney6.png" alt="">
                    </center>
                    <p>
                        After you check in, your phone acts as an NFC ticket for the Lightning Lane just like when
                        entering the park at the tap
                        styles. This would be a small animation on the left similar to when using Apple Pay. And the
                        dots in the middle would
                        pulse from left to right.

                    <p>
                        As I began exploring these new features and this brand new user flow, I knew that I needed to
                        build in an introduction
                        on how to use this new feature that will take up a lot of screen real estate for potentially a
                        long time. And I needed
                        to build a way to disable it completely.
                    </p>
                    <div class="side-by-side">
                        <img src="/assets/disney7.png" alt="">
                        <img src="/assets/disney8.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        So, I brought it to the user plain and simple. When they tap on the burger, where all the
                        settings are, for the first
                        time since the update, they see this splash screen. It gives a preview of what these
                        notifications will look like, what
                        they do, and exactly how to turn them off. The ability to be completely transparent with new app
                        features I believe is
                        critical to building trust and allowing for the acceptance of new features that could come
                        later.

                    <p>
                        Whether you like it or not, Live Activity notifications are coming. Soon, we'll see how much
                        large companies and businesses prioritize user experiences and start implementing easier ways to
                        interact with their app. This is one of the many ways that Disney can show care and deliver an
                        elevated experience, something they've prided their parks on for decades.

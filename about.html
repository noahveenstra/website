        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p class="desc">
            When I started to look at colleges and what I wanted to do, I decided on Computer Information Systems (CIS). I was worried about wasting time and leaving with a degree that didn't apply to my career. So, I chose something that I knew had a growing field and a lot of demand from major companies. My motivation for choosing to study this field was job security. I toured three schools in Michigan, including Michigan State University, Central Michigan University and Grand Valley State University. I decided on Grand Valley State because they had the program I was looking to study, and my older sister went there, so the campus wasn't foreign to me. All in all, I was excited to start learning skills that would allow me to grow and jumpstart my career. In the first semester, I started learning Java in Computer Science 1.
            <br><br>
            After less than a semester, I already started to feel like a computer science-heavy career was not what I wanted to do. Even though I enjoyed coding and solving problems with it, I didn't enjoy the way I needed to think to solve those problems. I had to wrestle a lot with deciding to abandon CIS. I felt like I was destined for that type of career and would be making a mistake to part away from it. 
            <br><br>
            When COVID came, it struck everyone and everything by surprise. This was especially apparent in my classes. The transition from in-person to online was a bumpy one, without a doubt. But, after a couple weeks of adapting and creating new systems to keep me on track, it seemed as back to normal as it could've. The remainder of the semester seemed to fly by as classes finished and finals were taken.
            <br><br>
            In the summer after, I received emails that classes would be staying online for at least the first semester back. I decided to go to community college. I was still in the thick of prerequisite classes, and classes at a community college have the same material as an acclaimed university. At Oakland Community College (OCC), I still declared my major as Computer Science because I knew this school was a stepping stone for the next one. At OCC, I was able to take Introduction to Databases and Professional Communication. 
            <br><br>
            During my first semester at OCC, I started looking for programs that would cater to my interests more than Computer Science. To my surprise, I found one that allowed me to be involved with light coding and create new designs for UI and Web interfaces. I thought this was a program that I had to look into more because of how interesting it sounded. Apparently, the only school in Michigan that offers this program is Michigan State University. After I learned about this, I contacted a friend and recent alum of MSU. I seemed to remember him having an interest in similar things as me and to my surprise, he chose to study exactly what I was looking for, User Experience Architecture. 
            <br><br>
            After talking to him and learning more about the program I was sold on it. I immediately applied to MSU and eventually got my acceptance letter after a bit of waiting. After finishing up the year at OCC, I was pleased with my decision to get some classes out of the way for a lot cheaper and still feel like I received a quality education. At MSU, I declared User Experience Architecture as my major. The first semester started online for the first couple of weeks. I started by taking Introduction to User Experience Architecture and Web Authoring in my first semester.
            <br><br>
            And that catches us up to now, in my second semester of MSU. Currently in Advanced Web Authoring and User Experience Research. Throughout these two semesters, I've self-taught myself how to properly deploy a website hosted through a 3rd party, HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript. I've already published one case study on my own site as well as on Medium. And currently, I'm working on a second study soon to be published.

        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p class="desc">
            Before coming to MSU, I spent the summer interning at ManpowerGroup NA. There, I worked on the Marketing Analytics team. After being welcomed in, I began to work on a new tool the team was looking to use called funnel.io. This tool "funneled" analytics from social media, ads, and even Google Analytics into a database. The most challenging part of this process was learning a whole new tool and being the only one at the company that was knowledgeable about it. 
            <br><br>
            After the funnel was set up, all the data was pushed to an SQL database. From that, I was tasked with creating a visual dashboard that was easy enough to use by the whole team and had granular data points for those who want to get deeper. To do this, I used Microsoft PowerBI. This was a completely new tool for me as well. I did my best to quickly get up to speed on how to utilize this insanely powerful well. After about a week I had a very rough dashboard put together. It took me another month or so to make it easily usable and certify that all the data was connected properly. The most difficult issue concerning the dashboard was the setup of all the data connectors. Making sure that the data was pulled and funneled in correctly using both funnel.io and Microsoft PowerBI was extremely difficult. I remember setting up multiple meetings per week with our data analyst who was also learning PowerBI and trying to pound it out with him. 
            <br><br>
            This internship taught me a lot about the corporate environment, expectations, and being able to deliver on time. Being able to learn quickly was a skill that I developed during that summer as well. Recalling the first couple of weeks, I was constantly Googling how to use these tools and watching webinars to understand them better.

        <h4>Personal</h4>
        <p class="desc">
            Growing up I was always fascinated by technology and more specifically, new technology. I still remember the first time my dad bought an iPhone and showed it all to us. At the time, it was the first device that I'd ever seen have a touch screen. Before that, the closest thing to a touch screen was a Nintendo DS. I was fascinated by his phone and the ones that followed. Being able to easily download apps, search questions right from your palm, and listen to music so simply and easily. Eventually, I'd saved up enough to buy an iPod Touch.
            <br><br>
            What drove this fascination for these devices was the experience I got from using them. The UI was fun, light, and felt like it flowed. I think it's something that Apple has kept in mind with all its products. It felt like the iPod Touch and iPhone were designed with the customer in mind first. This was my first exposure to a thoughtful human-centered design. I believe that because of these devices I continued to pursue a career focused on technology and the experience of the users.
            <br><br>
            During the same time, our family had a sort of tradition of taking trips to Disney World in Florida. We all enjoyed it even to this day. One thing that I started to be more and more aware of the older I got was the amount of effort Disney put into treating their guests a certain way. Creating this aura of magic and always trying to make it the best day. The attention to detail is astonishing in the experiences they create. This is also something that I always admired growing up and hope to replicate in my work throughout my career.

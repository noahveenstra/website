                with appearances in Vouge, Bazaar and Chicago Mag. They approached me in order toget their website off

                an e-commerce site from scratch.

Although, there are a few key features that are just missing for this premier service. I take a look into how some changes will affect its success and popularity using peer reviewed research papers and present my findings in high fidelity mock-ups.</div>

        <div class="desc">Growing up, I kind of knew I would end up somewhere around technology for my career. The course that it took I did not expect. My dad is a senior software engineer and taught me more about technology than most. Not only did this feed my curiosity but it allowed me to delve deeper into it. When I got to high school I was eager to start learning new skills and enrolled in an Intro to HTML class. From there I've been learning more and more about how to efficiently create and design websites and more importantly, craft their experiences.</div>
